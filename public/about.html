<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Michal Strouhal and I'm 20 years old. I'm from Czech Republic and I live in a small village, I mean really small. Our village has 20 residents. I study at industrial high school at Vla≈°im but I don't really like the school. Thats why I started this course. My whole life dream is to become web developer.</p>
<p>This is the opportunity to make my future better. At least I hope.</p>
